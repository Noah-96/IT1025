## Executive Summary
If I were to tell you how the whole started back in the 50s you wouldn't believe me, because you would say; “they didn’t have computers way back then”. You’d be wrong how it all started with giant size tape recorders, and how it leads to us having a vast array of Information systems in not only our pockets, well just about everywhere. I know it doesn’t look like it at first, but it’s true. In this class, I hope to find out how do systems truly, work and see what makes them operate.

### Client - Server Architecture
Client-server architecture is a structure that if the client is searching for a resource it would submit their request to the server, the server responds to the client with the best website for the client. It works like how you would regularly look up info on the internet and give you the best response or forum the server can find. In some ways, it’s software that serves as and search engine, providing the best solution or work-study the client is in need of.
### Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing Cloud Computing is when a user saves all their data and memory onto the internet. It can all be stored in a “cloud” which is a software that can be accessed when in an area of the internet, wifi, or if the user has roaming data. It is very useful for people whose career is in the IT field, for most of their job requires them to be collecting and saving data. It is cannot be limited, due to the internet being its storage database.[IT1025_Fall_2021 (1).docx](https://github.com/ktamerl4/IT1025/files/7113051/IT1025_Fall_2021.1.docx)

## Conclusion
I found this lab very informative. It taught me much about certain aspects that I didn’t know about such as; Components in information system, RAM, and CPU, also the IEEE and their organization. I believe Lab 1 introduction and Github would be beneficial to my future career in the field of cybersecurity. I find Github to be useful in my Client-server workstation, for future projects. I also would like to add I would think the more we go through this course that we go into the depths of CPUs, and RAMs. ,=Inputs and Outputs were also a challenge for me too, but i will study up on it more on my own time.
